# Introduction
The research question is this: is there a diffrence in the average amount of alcohol consumed per week by students who sit in row 1, row 2 or row3 the UCdavis classroom


$H_0$: There is no difference between the average number of drinks imbibed between people based on the row they sit in.

$H_A$: The average number drinks is different between at least two rows.


# Methods

Data from UC Davis: Seat is categorical, and alcohol is numerical, so we used the Numerical~Cat helper file

# Description 
## graphical description


```{r}
boxplot(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
```

This boxplot shows that students who sit in the back row tend to drink more

# Conclusion and Discussion

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
